**Disclaimer**
This project was the second milestone on my Python journey. I completed it in May 2024, as an assignment for a Full Stack Development course I’m currently taking. The original guideline was much simpler than this, so I decided to give it a twist and make it a bit more challenging. Just like I did with Scrabble Scorekeeper, I’m posting this project as close to the original as possible, even though I would definitely do some things differently nowadays (like the tester functions, which can be easily replaced by string methods). However, since I want to do an honest tracking of my progress, here we are. I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement!

**Overview**
Welcome to the ROULETTE SPINNER, a project developed by Francisco Cristina (https://github.com/gumballoon). This is a simulation of a roulette game where users can place bets on colors or specific numbers and track their balance. For detailed instructions and information, please refer to the README below.

	•	Deposit Management: Allows users to deposit money into their balance.
	•	Betting: Users can place bets on either a specific number or a color (red/black).
	•	Random Slogans: Displays a random slogan each time the menu is shown.
	•	Balance Tracking: Keeps track of the user's balance and updates it based on game outcomes.
	•	Outcome Messages: Provides feedback based on the user's final balance when quitting the game.

**Installation**
